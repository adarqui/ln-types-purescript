# purescript-ln-types

types auto-generated from ln-types, for purescript.

## why?

experimental splitting of types into their own modules instead of one big module.

## building

must have my purescript-foreign-extras library in ../ because I have custom instances for Tuple and Maybe.

```
make bower
```
